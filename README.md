# KO-Portfolio

KO-Portfolio is a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) based web application runs on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) platform that serves a static content. The KO-Portfolio application is based on [Express](http://expressjs.com) framework for back-end and [EJS](https://ejs.co) templating + JavaScript for front-end. Also, the application contains authentication and authorization methods based on username, password, and [JWT](https://jwt.io).

The major goal of this project is to create a web application that will serve a portfolio of a UX Designer. The side effect is to develop and enhance the skills of the developer of this project, such as web development (in JavaScript), containerization, and CI/ CD automation within the cloud environment, especially, AWS.
